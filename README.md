## Patient Health Journey Prediction using Hidden Sem-Markov Models (HSMM)
This study aims to develop a predictive model for analyzing patient health journeys and medication adherence patterns to help GoodRx improve patient outcomes. Using synthetic data from Synthea™ comprising 4,363 hypertension patients, we adapt a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) framework to classify and predict patient health journeys. The methodology combines k-means clustering, PCA, and HSMM to analyze unobservable health states through observed symptoms and medications. We expect to develop a classification model that can effectively predict patients’ future health status while providing actionable insights for improving medication adherence and patient utility.
